# Brand guidelines for Uplo in your project or site

Community and third-party \(non-core\) projects are an essential part of the Uplo ecosystem. They expand the use-cases for Uplo, and improve the network with solutions we aren’t actively working on.

We want users to be able to distinguish between core and non-core projects for a number of reasons:

* Non-core projects typically involve a bit of centralization, and that’s ok. Users need choice, and centralization provides features that are much easier to implement than can be done on Uplo.
* People might confuse your project with something built by the core team, and we want to make sure users know who to go to for help.
* You worked hard on your project, and we want it to stand out!

In an effort to promote these goals, please use the following as guidelines when developing your brand.

## Official Uplo assets

[Get them here](https://github.com/uplocloud/brand-assets-official). It includes our logo and wordmark in a variety of high-quality formats, as well as the built with Uplo logo for third-party projects.

If you are building a project featuring Uplo, use the `built with Uplo` logo to showcase your integration. You can drop this in the app, website, or anywhere else that makes sense.

## Naming your project

You have a lot of freedom here. Feel free to use the word “Uplo” however you want in your project, with two exceptions:

* Don’t call your project “Uplo”. Because that’s our name.
* Don't use the term “Uplo” and then a generic term that directly relates to our business like “Cloud”, “Storage”, or "Backup".

Some examples of acceptable naming are: UploStats, Uplosync, UploWiki, and Uplomining. You know it's about Uplo, and get a good idea of what specifically the project might focus on.

Just remember, if you’re trying to make a play on words, we pronounce Uplo like “up-low” and not “U-P-L-O”.

You can also create a wonderfully custom name that represents you or your work. Some examples are projects like Pixeldrain, Filebase, and roadie.

## Logo and Wordmark

We’re a little more strict on this one. We are in the process of registering the trademarks in Australia for both the Uplo logo and wordmark:

We’d prefer that your project not use the Uplo logo or wordmark directly in any capacity, but you can style on it as long as a normal user wouldn’t confuse it for the real thing.

We hope to have a good example of this soon:

## Colours

Uplo uses two main colours.

If you use the exact Uplo logo or wordmark in any way, like to represent the fact that you integrate with Uplo on your site, the image should either use our blue or grey. Alternatively you can also use an all-white logo for contrast on darker backgrounds. In other words, don't use our exact logo or wordmark and change the colour to match your colour scheme.
When designing your own logo, feel free to draw from our color palette or create your own.

We can't wait to see what you build! Be sure you let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b2s3P9Cy6F).
